    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <p id="Q">What is the deal with the venue?</p>
    <p> The <a href="https://primitivepursuits.com/arnot-forest/" target="_blank">venue</a> is a classic summer camp location surrounded by the hilly Arnot forest. The forest contains a small number of open fields, ponds, and streams, hosts two maple syrup research facilities, and numerous managed hiking trails. </p>

    <p>The campus itself has covered pagodas, a main lodge with an industrial kitchen, and 12 cabins flanking a large field. There are two firepits and fields suitable for tent camping. </p>

    <p>We have the entire campus for the weekend and hope to host many of you during that time. Bathroom facilities include showers and toilets in a bath house area. </p>

    <p id="Q">How accessible is the venue?</p>
    <p>The lodge and bathhouses are wheelchair accessible, however the cabins are not. The entire area is hilly and grass covered, though there is a main gravel road which acts as an artery from the entrance / parking area to the main lodge and covered pagodas.</p>

    <p id="Q">How should I get there?</p>
    <p> The <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Arnot+Forest/@42.264906,-76.6288876,427m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89d07ac4d7e911f5:0x85a6c0478a35124c!8m2!3d42.2642252!4d-76.6275787" target="_blank">location</a> is accessible via car (half an hour outside of Ithaca), and parking is available.</p>

    <p>For travelers coming from out of town: Ithaca is in the center of New York state, 4 hours driving from NYC. There are buses provided by Greyhound, OurBus, and FlixBus. The venue is 30 minutes from airports in Ithaca and Elmira. For a greater flight selection, you may also want to consider airports in Binghamton, Syracuse, or Rochester. </p>

    <p id="Q">What else can I do around the area? </p>

    <p>The finger lakes offer an abundance of natural beauty in the form of lakes, waterfalls, gorges, rolling hills, and verdant land. Small-town charm can be found all around, and Ithaca / Watkins Glen are great destinations for a curated taste of life near the lakes.</p>

    <p id="Q">Where should I stay?</p>
    <p>We have unlimited space for tent or car camping on Friday and Saturday night, as well as a limited number of rustic cabins. If you have a spot in a cabin (we have been in touch), be sure to bring linens and a pillow.</p>

    <p>If you’re not <i>inspired</i> by tents or cabins: Availability of lodgings in Ithaca can be limited during peak seasons (like Cornell move-in), so we suggest not to delay in finding a place to stay. Given that some of you may be interested in coordinating lodgings, please use the document shared with you via email.</p>

    <!-- <p id="Q">How do I get a cabin?</p>

    <p>There are 12 rustic cabins which can each accommodate 4-8. There are a handful of spots in shared cabins available. Fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/JeKjXKxdHUaVBGQc9" target="_blank">this form</a> if you’d like to request a spot. We can’t make any promises, but we will do our best to allocate the space.</p> -->

    <p id="Q">What is the schedule of the events?</p>

    <p>See above. TL;DR the main events will be on Saturday afternoon and evening, including a catered dinner. Activities will be mostly outdoors. You are welcome to stay at the venue Friday evening until Sunday midday.</p>

    <p id="Q">What is the food and drink situation?</p>
    <p>Besides a catered dinner on Saturday, we will be cooking meals in the mess hall together (summer camp!). Every meal will include options that satisfy the dietary preferences/restrictions expressed in your RSVPs. As we have an industrial kitchen and food storage available, anyone is welcome to bring their own food and store/prepare it---just give us a head up. We plan to provide wine, beer, and a variety of non-alcoholic drinks.</p>

    <p id="Q">Is there a dress code?</p>
    <p>Wear whatever you want! We suggest that you prioritize comfort. For those interested in camping, this is a great opportunity to pack your unnecessary, but much loved glamping gadgets and patagucci. When planning for comfort consider that NY in the summer can at its worst be muddy, muggy, and buggy.</p>
    <p>Word on the street is that collared shirts, shorts, and sundresses will be common. There will also be a contingent wearing high tech performance fabrics.</p>

    <!-- <p id="Q">How should I let you know if I am able to attend?</p>
    <p>We will send out an RVSP form in mid to late spring.</p> -->

    <p id="Q">Can I bring a plus one? How about my kid(s)? My dog?</p>
    <p>Yes, yes, no. Unfortunately, the campus does not allow pets.</p>

    <p id="Q">Do you have a gift registry?</p>
    <p>We really do not need or want gifts! Instead, we ask for your presence, participation, and help during the weekend. From setup to teardown to cooking to cleaning, there will be plenty of work to do! <!-- The RSVP will include a place to indicate whether you’re willing to help with setup, cleanup, cooking, etc. --></p>
